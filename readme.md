Gengo Swift Library (for the [Gengo API](http://gengo.com/api/))
================================================================================================================================

This is a swift library made for the [Gengo](http://www.gengo.com) API. It allows users to order and manage their translations directly from their iOS devices. This is still a work in progress so any contributions are welcome :) 

## Installing

Just include the SwiftHTTP folder in your project and the Gengo.swift file as well.

## Usage
```swift
//Initialization
let private_key = "MY_PRIVATE_KEY"
let public_key = "MY_PUBLIC_KEY"
let gengo = Gengo(public_key: public_key, private_key: private_key, useSandbox: true)
    
//post a translation job
var data = [
        "jobs": [
            "job_1": [
                "type": "text",
                "slug": "Single :: English to Japanese",
                "body_src": "Testing Gengo API library calls.",
                "lc_src": "en",
                "lc_tgt": "ja",
                "tier": "standard",
                "auto_approve": 0,
                "comment": "HEY THERE TRANSLATOR",
                "custom_data": "your optional custom data, limited to 1kb.",
                "force":  0,
                "use_preferred": 0
            ]
        ]
    ]
gengo.postTranslationJobs(data)
```

Output:

    {"opstat":"ok","response":{"order_id":"306930","job_count":1,"credits_used":"0.25","currency":"USD"}}
